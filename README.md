I was really curious on how to do dropdown lists in css for future uses in case I ever need to use it for my own site in the future for a personal project of mine. The article tells me how to do the basics dropdown from the navigation but also multi-level dropdowns for even more categories. 
This is very useful for organizing your layout and keeping it well organized. I've experienced a handful of websites with cluttered navigation but this way will keep it simple and easy to navigate. Definitely keeping this article for future reference.
